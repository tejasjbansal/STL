1. STL Standard Template Library
    The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide
    common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.
    It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.
    It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.
    A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

2. It consist of three components
    a. container
    b. iterators
    c. Algorithm

(a) container
    Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard 
    “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header 
    files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

   # Sequence Containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.

                                        vector
                                        list
                                        deque
                                        arrays
                                        forward_list( Introduced in C++11)

    # Container Adaptors : provide a different interface for sequential containers.

                                        queue
                                        priority_queue
                                        stack

    # Associative Containers : implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).

                                        set
                                        multiset
                                        map
                                        multimap

    # Unordered Associative Containers : implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched

                            unordered_set (Introduced in C++11)
                            unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11)
                            unordered_map (Introduced in C++11)
                            unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)
(b). iterators
    As the name suggests, iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values.
    They are the major feature that allow generality in STL.

(c) Algorithm
    The header algorithm defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements.
    They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.
